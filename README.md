## Learning Goals:

The goal of this project was to showcase my knowledge and abilities working with React ,React Router ,Asynchronous JavaScript and End to end testing with Cypress

## Wins + Challenges:

A big win for me was getting everything from the api to display correctly. The discogs API is massive and has a ton of data so sorting through that correctly and getting it to display was a big win.
